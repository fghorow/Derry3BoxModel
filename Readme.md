Derry3BoxModel
==============

A 3 box (atmosphere, surface ocean, and deep ocean) model of climate dynamics originally written by Lou Derry in Matlab after "Numerical Adventures with Geochemical Cycles", ch. 5, Walker (1991).

Frank Horowitz is responsible for the translation into Python, and the (currently planned) implementation of the model into a webapp.
